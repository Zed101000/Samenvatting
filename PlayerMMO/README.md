# PlayerMMO Design Patterns Implementation

> A comprehensive C# implementation of 15 essential design patterns demonstrated through a game development context

## 🎯 Overview

This project showcases all major design patterns through a **PlayerMMO** game framework, providing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation. Each pattern is demonstrated with working code, UML diagrams, and real game scenarios.

## 🏗️ Creational Patterns
*Patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms*

### Abstract Factory Pattern
![Abstract Factory](./AbstractFactory/abstract_factory.png)
**Creates families of related game objects** - Build complete cave or dungeon environments with their associated monsters, items, and terrain.
- [📖 Detailed Implementation](./Summaries/AbstractFactory.md) | [💻 Code](./AbstractFactory/) | [🎨 Generic UML](./AbstractFactory/generic_abstract_factory.png)

### Builder Pattern  
![Builder](./Builder/builder.png)
**Constructs complex player objects step-by-step** - Create customized player characters with fluent interface and optional configurations.
- [📖 Detailed Implementation](./Summaries/Builder.md) | [💻 Code](./Builder/) | [🎨 Generic UML](./Builder/generic_builder.png)

### Factory Method Pattern
![Factory Method](./Factory/factory_method.png)
**Creates player classes through subclass decisions** - Generate different player types (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Paladin) through specialized factories.
- [📖 Detailed Implementation](./Summaries/FactoryMethod.md) | [💻 Code](./Factory/) | [🎨 Generic UML](./Factory/generic_factory_method.png)

### Singleton Pattern
![Singleton](./Singleton/singleton.png)
**Ensures single instance of game state** - Maintain global game configuration and state management throughout the application.
- [📖 Detailed Implementation](./Summaries/Singleton.md) | [💻 Code](./Singleton/) | [🎨 Generic UML](./Singleton/generic_singleton.png)

---

## 🎭 Behavioral Patterns
*Patterns that focus on communication between objects and assignment of responsibilities*

### Command Pattern
![Command](./Command/command.png)
**Encapsulates game actions as objects** - Implement undo/redo functionality for player actions like attacks, movements, and item usage.
- [📖 Detailed Implementation](./Summaries/Command.md) | [💻 Code](./Command/) | [🎨 Generic UML](./Command/generic_command.png)

### Iterator Pattern
![Iterator](./Iterator/iterator.png)
**Provides sequential access to player collections** - Traverse party members, inventory items, and enemy groups with different iteration strategies.
- [📖 Detailed Implementation](./Summaries/Iterator.md) | [💻 Code](./Iterator/) | [🎨 Generic UML](./Iterator/generic_iterator.png)

### Observer Pattern
![Observer](./Observer/observer.png)
**Implements event notification system** - Notify multiple game systems when player events occur (leveling up, dying, collecting items).
- [📖 Detailed Implementation](./Summaries/Observer.md) | [💻 Code](./Observer/) | [🎨 Generic UML](./Observer/generic_observer.png)

### State Pattern
![State](./State/state.png)
**Changes player behavior based on internal state** - Alter player capabilities based on health, mana, and status conditions.
- [📖 Detailed Implementation](./Summaries/State.md) | [💻 Code](./State/) | [🎨 Generic UML](./State/generic_state.png)

### Strategy Pattern
![Strategy](./Strategy/strategy.png)
**Encapsulates interchangeable combat algorithms** - Switch between different attack strategies and combat behaviors dynamically.
- [📖 Detailed Implementation](./Summaries/Strategy.md) | [💻 Code](./Strategy/) | [🎨 Generic UML](./Strategy/generic_strategy.png)

### Template Method Pattern
![Template Method](./Template/template_method.png)
**Defines game level progression framework** - Create standardized level structures while allowing customization of specific level behaviors.
- [📖 Detailed Implementation](./Summaries/TemplateMethod.md) | [💻 Code](./Template/) | [🎨 Generic UML](./Template/generic_template_method.png)

---

## 🏛️ Structural Patterns
*Patterns that deal with object composition and relationships*

### Adapter Pattern
![Adapter](./Adapter/Adapter.png)
**Makes incompatible weapon interfaces work together** - Integrate legacy weapon systems with modern game engines seamlessly.
- [📖 Detailed Implementation](./Summaries/Adapter.md) | [💻 Code](./Adapter/) | [🎨 Generic UML](./Adapter/generic_adapter.png)

### Composite Pattern
![Composite](./Composite/composite.png)
**Treats individual and composite game objects uniformly** - Build hierarchical structures like inventories, party formations, and game world trees.
- [📖 Detailed Implementation](./Summaries/Composite.md) | [💻 Code](./Composite/) | [🎨 Generic UML](./Composite/generic_composite.png)

### Decorator Pattern
![Decorator](./Decorator/Decorator.png)
**Adds behavior dynamically to weapons and items** - Stack multiple enhancements on weapons (fire, ice, critical hit) without modifying original objects.
- [📖 Detailed Implementation](./Summaries/Decorator.md) | [💻 Code](./Decorator/) | [🎨 Generic UML](./Decorator/generic_decorator.png)

### Facade Pattern
![Facade](./Facade/facade.png)
**Provides simplified interface to complex game subsystems** - Coordinate multiple game engines (audio, graphics, input) through single interface.
- [📖 Detailed Implementation](./Summaries/Facade.md) | [💻 Code](./Facade/) | [🎨 Generic UML](./Facade/generic_facade.png)

### Proxy Pattern
![Proxy](./Proxy/proxy.png)
**Controls access to game resources** - Implement lazy loading, caching, and permission systems for expensive game assets.
- [📖 Detailed Implementation](./Summaries/Proxy.md) | [💻 Code](./Proxy/) | [🎨 Generic UML](./Proxy/generic_proxy.png)

## 🎮 Core Game Framework

All patterns integrate with a common game foundation:

```csharp
// Core interfaces used throughout all patterns
public interface IPlayer {
    string Name { get; set; }
    int Health { get; set; }
    int Level { get; set; }
    // Additional game-specific properties
}

public interface IMonster {
    string Name { get; set; }
    int Health { get; set; }
    int Level { get; set; }
    // Monster-specific behaviors
}

public class BasePlayer : IPlayer {
    // Default player implementation
    // Used as foundation across all patterns
}
```

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

5. **💻 Run the Code** - Execute working demos and experiment with implementations

## 🔗 Pattern Relationships

Many patterns work together in this implementation:
- **Factory + Singleton**: Factories often implemented as singletons
- **Command + Strategy**: Commands can use different execution strategies  
- **Composite + Iterator**: Traverse complex hierarchical structures
- **Observer + State**: Notify systems when object states change
- **Decorator + Strategy**: Enhanced objects using different algorithms
