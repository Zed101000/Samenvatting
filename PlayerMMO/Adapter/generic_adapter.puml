title Generic Adapter Pattern

interface Target {
    +Request(): void
}

class Adaptee {
    +SpecificRequest(): void
}

class Adapter {
    -adaptee: Adaptee
    +Adapter(adaptee: Adaptee)
    +Request(): void
}

class Client {
    +UseTarget(target: Target): void
}

Adapter ..|> Target
Adapter --> Adaptee : adapts
Client --> Target : uses

note right of Target
  Target defines interface
  that client expects to use
end note

note bottom of Adaptee
  Adaptee has useful functionality
  but incompatible interface
  that needs to be adapted
end note

note right of Adapter
  Adapter implements Target interface
  and translates calls to Adaptee:
  
  Request() {
    adaptee.SpecificRequest();
  }
end note

note left of Client
  Client works with Target interface.
  Doesn't know about Adaptee or
  that adaptation is happening
end note
